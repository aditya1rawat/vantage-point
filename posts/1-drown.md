Synchronised hearts screaming the ordinary,
Frightened of the sharp whispers in their eyes,
Trapped inside the shadows of expectations,
Hiding behind the bitter conventional walls.
Let the soft hues of your words take over,
Sweeping away the black and white world;
Let your crackling blood flood their minds,
Lining their veins with zealous fireworks;
Let the gracious wind swirling in your soul,
Spread through the rigid norms of humanity;
Let the spark gleaming through your eyes,
Inspire them to drown in their own freedom.
